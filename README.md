# **Lung Cancer Prediction**

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient data and clinical features. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

---


## **Project Overview**
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer using patient data. The solution is aimed at improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.

**Key Objectives**:
- Build a predictive model for lung cancer diagnosis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the dataset.
- Create a user-friendly interface to predict outcomes based on input features.

---

## **Features**
- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Comparison of model performances using key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Visualization of results and insights.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains clinical and demographic data of patients. It includes features like age, smoking history, genetic predisposition, and diagnostic metrics. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Note**: Ensure to comply with any licensing or ethical considerations related to the dataset.
